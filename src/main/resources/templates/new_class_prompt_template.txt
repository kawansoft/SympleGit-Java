I will pass you 4 Java classes:
- SympleGit: the main class.
- GitCommander: a class that allows to pass Git commands and get output and errors.
- GitWrapper: an interface for Git Wrapper classes 
- GitBranch: a simplified example of a wrapper class that does an only update & anonly read Git operation


These classes will be used as a guideline for building a new Wrapper class:
I want you to write following these guidelines a GitAdder class that will have two methods:
addAll() and add(List<String> File)
