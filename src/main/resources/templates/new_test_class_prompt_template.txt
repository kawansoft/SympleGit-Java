Please write a complete unit test class for the class ${0}.
Use this Java line to get the repository File:
File repoDir = GitTestUtils.createTemporaryGitRepo();
        
As the repoDirt is real and exists as Git repo, don't use mock in the code, use only real calls.      
        
The value of ${0} name is at the end of this prompt.
