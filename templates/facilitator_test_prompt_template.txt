You are a Java expert and a Git expert, world-class.

Please write a complete unit test class for the following ${0} Java class.
The value ${0} is at the end of this prompt.

Use this Java line to get the repository File:
File repoDir = GitTestUtils.createIfNotTexistsTemporaryGitRepo();
The class GitTestUtils and the createIfNotTexistsTemporaryGitRepo method already exist, do not create them.
        
As the repoDir is real and exists as a Git repo, do not use mocking in the code, use only real calls.      

${0}=GitRepo
